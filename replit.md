# AnimalDrive - Cloud File Storage Platform

## Overview

AnimalDrive is a modern cloud file storage platform built with a React frontend and Express.js backend. The application provides file upload, organization, sharing, and management capabilities with a playful animal-themed interface. It uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and includes comprehensive authentication through Replit Auth.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Database Storage: User wants unlimited PostgreSQL storage capacity.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **File Handling**: React Dropzone for drag-and-drop file uploads

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **File Upload**: Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless hosting
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem storage in uploads directory
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **users**: User profiles and authentication data (required for Replit Auth)
- **sessions**: Session storage for authentication (required for Replit Auth)
- **folders**: Hierarchical folder organization with parent-child relationships
- **files**: File metadata including name, size, mime type, and storage path
- **sharedFiles**: File sharing with access control and time-based tokens

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OIDC discovery
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with configurable TTL
- **Access Control**: Route-level authentication middleware
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and profile management

### File Management
- **Upload**: Multi-file upload with progress tracking and size limits (100MB)
- **Organization**: Folder-based hierarchy with unlimited nesting
- **Search**: Full-text search across file names and metadata
- **Preview**: Modal-based file preview for images, videos, and documents
- **Sharing**: Token-based file sharing with access level controls

### User Interface
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui components with custom animal theme
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant components and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimized with React Query caching and lazy loading

## Data Flow

### File Upload Process
1. User drags files to upload zone or clicks to select
2. Frontend validates file types and sizes
3. Files sent via FormData to `/api/files/upload` endpoint
4. Backend processes files with Multer middleware
5. File metadata stored in database with generated unique filenames
6. Success response triggers UI refresh via React Query cache invalidation

### Authentication Flow
1. Unauthenticated users redirected to `/api/login`
2. Replit Auth handles OIDC flow with external provider
3. Successful authentication creates/updates user record
4. Session established with PostgreSQL-backed store
5. Frontend receives user data via `/api/auth/user` endpoint

### File Organization
1. Users can create nested folder structures
2. Files can be moved between folders via drag-and-drop
3. Breadcrumb navigation shows current folder hierarchy
4. Search functionality queries across all user files regardless of folder

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL connection with serverless WebSocket support
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations and migrations
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible UI primitives for complex components
- **multer**: File upload handling and storage configuration

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server with hot module replacement
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking and enhanced developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with design tokens
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with autoprefixer support

### Authentication
- **openid-client**: OIDC client implementation for Replit Auth
- **passport**: Authentication middleware with session management
- **express-session**: Session handling with configurable storage
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store adapter

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Hot Reload**: Full-stack hot reloading with Vite middleware
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, REPLIT_DOMAINS

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Single Node.js process serving both static files and API
- **Process Management**: PM2 or similar for production process supervision

### Database Management
- **Schema Migrations**: Drizzle Kit handles schema changes automatically
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon serverless with WebSocket connections
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic session expiration and cleanup
- **Backup Strategy**: Neon provides automated backups and point-in-time recovery

## Recent Changes

### January 2025 - Mobile Responsive Design Optimization
- Optimized header for mobile with collapsible search bar and compact layout
- Made file grid responsive with proper spacing and sizing for small screens
- Added mobile-specific CSS rules to prevent horizontal scrolling
- Improved touch targets and prevented iOS zoom on input focus
- Optimized image editor with flexible layout for mobile devices
- Enhanced button sizes and spacing for better mobile usability

### January 2025 - Enhanced File Editing Capabilities
- Built comprehensive enhanced file viewer with zoom, rotate controls for images
- Created simple image editor with brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments
- Added transform features: rotate, flip horizontal/vertical for images
- Developed audio/video player with advanced playback controls
- Integrated editing features with existing file management system
- All editors accessible through view and edit modes in main interface

### January 2025 - Migration to Replit Environment  
- Successfully migrated project from Replit Agent to native Replit environment
